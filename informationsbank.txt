===================

* Syntax Equations (Backus-Naur Form)

* Lexical scanning, finite automata

* Parsing theory

* Intermediate languages (P-code, reverse Polish representation)

	* P-code, Portable-code, code for a hypothetical CPU like JVM!
	* Polish representation, aka prefix notation. Reverse polish notation is postfix operands

* Subroutines, argument passing

* Instruction set
	* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings

* JVM Stacks and Heap

	* Stack: Program counter, byte sized operands and byte sized instructions?
	* Heap
	* Threads? Scheduling?

* GC? Na.. :P

* Classfile file format

	* Magic Number
	* Constant table
	* List of Fields??
	* List of Methods?? (Signatures?)
	* Method code

* Java grammar


* Optimization




Approach:

Top-down, recursive descent parsing. Fail fast.
No error recovery. Subsset of Java.
